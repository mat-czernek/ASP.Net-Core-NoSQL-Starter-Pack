# ASP.Net Core and NoSQL database starter pack

Small project to show how to handle basic operations on NoSQL database.

## Getting Started

For testing purposes you can use Cloudant database from IBM Cloud Platform. It's available for free (no credit card information required). Free Cloudant service has some limitations, but for small app or just for tests is more than enough.

Here is a link to IBM Cloud console: https://console.bluemix.net/

Here is Cloudant documenation: https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/Cloudant/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-cloudant


Don't forget to modify appsettings.json file to specify database name, host and user credentials.
